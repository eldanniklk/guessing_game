# 🎯 Guessing Game in Rust

This is my first project in **Rust**, a classic "Guess the Number" game.  
The goal is to get familiar with the language, its ecosystem, and best practices.

## 🚀 What is it about?

The program:
1. Generates a random number between `1` and `100`.
2. Asks the user to input their guess.
3. Compares the input with the secret number.
4. Informs if the number is **too small**, **too big**, or if you have **won** 🎉.

## 🦀 Why Rust?

- Rust is fast, safe, and widely used in modern ecosystems.  
- It’s a great way to train your mind in concepts like memory management, concurrency, and safety.  
- Learning it step by step prepares me to work on real-world projects.
